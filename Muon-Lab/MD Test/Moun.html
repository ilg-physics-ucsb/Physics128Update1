<h2 id="impedance">Impedance</h2>
<p>If you studied analog electronics, you’ve had some experience with impedances and this section may just serve as review. Impedance is something one considers when dealing with time varying signals is frequency dependent. It is analogous to resistance for direct current (DC) circuits. It is expressed as a complex number.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z = R + iX(f)\]</span></p>
<p>For this lab we don’t need to consider the consider the frequency dependent part of the lab. (I actually don’t know, this is just a test an assumption. If so should we have the students do a calculation?) So we will focus on the real part of the impedance.</p>
<p>In analog circuits, when you connect two circuits together you typically as trying to pass information about the voltage from one circuit to the next. It would not be good if the second circuit were to affect the voltage signal from the first circuit. To limit the effect of the second circuit on the first you were taught that the first circuit should have a low output impedance, and the second circuit should have high input impedance.</p>
<p>Here is simplified drawing of connecting two circuits. We want all fo the voltage information from the circuit in device A to be passed the circuit in device B. We want <span class="math inline">\(V_{in}=V_{out}\)</span>. We further simplify the model of the two circuits by drawing the device as a simple voltage divider.</p>

<p>Given the voltage divider above. Discuss with your partner why we would like <span class="math inline">\(Z_{out} &lt;&lt; Z_{in}\)</span> in order for <span class="math inline">\(V_{in} \approx V_{out}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Use a BNC cable to connect the PMT to the oscilloscope. Describe what you see. Now use a BNC “T” to connect to the oscilloscope. Connect the BNC going to the PMT to the oscilloscope to the BNC “T”. Lastly, add a <span class="math inline">\(50\Omega\)</span> terminator to the other end of the BNC “T”. Now what do you see?</p>
